# Water Quality Prediction
Turbidity value of Water is predicted using a regressive neural network. The water samples and their turbidity value were first measured using turbidity sensor then the image of that sample is taken. A dataframe of image and its turbidity value is created. The neural network is trained using this dataframe.
